For example, in our case, an arrow that hits the center of the archery target will land in position (0, 0) on the coordinate axes. \n","\n","The space can be divided into 4 zones (quadrants): Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4. If a point is in Q1, both its x coordinate and y coordinate are positive. Any point with a null x or y coordinate is considered to not belong to any quadrant. \n","\n","If you want to know more about the cartesian coordinate system, you can check this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system). \n","\n","## Tools\n","You don't necessarily need to use all the tools.
